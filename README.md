##The Structure And Assembly Of Rhizobacterial Communities Influenced by Poplar Genotype in sandy soils

- This project contains the source code from the manuscript."The Structure And Assembly Of Rhizobacterial Communities Influenced by Poplar Genotype in sandy soils"

- Documents ended with **.R** are the main R script for the corresponding analyses. Those ended simply with **.r** are required functions. Those ended with **.csv**, **.tre**, **.txt**etc. are required datasets.

- "code.R" contains the main codes of this study. "hub_node.r" is a necessary function for computing the hub node.

- ###The main code includes:
- Fig.1E~H The difference of bacterial Î²-diversity (E, F, G, H) and Table.S1
- Fig.2A The composition of bacterial community in rhizosphere and bulk soils at the level of phylum 
- Fig.4 The co-occurrence networks (A) and hub nodes (B)
- Fig.5 The correlation matrix between soil nutrient properties and abundant bacteria genera (the relative abundance over 1%) in rhizosphere and bulk soils of poplar
- Fig.6 Threshold indicator taxa analysis
- Fig.7 Community assembly analysis  NTI and BNTI
